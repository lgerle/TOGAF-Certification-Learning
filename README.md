<h2 style="text-align: center;">What are the top 10 tips for passing the TOGAF Certification Exam?</h2>
&nbsp;

At Web Age, our TOGAF Certification Training Courses are fully-accredited by The Open Group. We have trained hundreds of people to pass the TOGAF Certification Exam over many years and in that time our trainers have distilled some really important tips for those hoping to do the same.

We have detailed these tips below to give you some insight on what you need to know to easily pass the TOGAF Certification exam.


<h3>1. Invest the Time</h3>
The TOGAF 9 book (which contains the content from specification) is almost 800 pages long. Taking our accredited TOGAF Certification training course (TOGAF 9.2)  is a good start (with trainers who can guide you in what to expect in the TOGAF Certification exam and how to use TOGAF in practice) but it will not be enough typically to pass the exam. You need to dedicate at least 3 to 5 more full days to immersing yourself in TOGAF Certification training before you will be ready to take the TOGAF Certification exam – and this must include completing as many practice exams for both Parts 1 and 2 as you can lay your hands on!

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Note: Our TOGAF® 9 Training Course: Combined (Level 1 &amp; 2) includes TOGAF  Exam Vouchers!  During the course, you will receive a voucher allowing you to schedule the TOGAF® Standard Version 9.2 Level 1 and Level 2 certification exam.</span>

<h3>2. Understand how the TOGAF Certification exam is graded.</h3>
Part 1 of the TOGAF Certification exam is a multiple choice exam with 4 or 5 possible answers to choose from for each question. Only one answer is right – and if you do not select it you get zero for the question. Since you need to score 22 correct answers, you can only get 18 questions wrong before you will fail the exam. So it is important that you know your TOGAF definitions and foundational content. Do not try to reason your way through Part 1! And keep in mind that you will not be allowed to progress to Part 2 without first obtaining a passing grade in Part 1.

Part 2 is different. Still a multiple choice exam but each question (of the 8 that will be in the exam) has 4 possible answers, only one of which will score you zero marks. You should try to select the best answer – which will score you 5 points – but in order to pass the exam you only need to score 24 points out of 40. A quick calculation tells you that if you select the second-best response and subsequently score 3 points in each of the 8 questions you will score a total of 24 points and pass the exam. Since there are 4 choices to pick from, you have a 50/50 chance of passing the exam using only pure chance! I do not recommend this of course – instead try to find the distracter and eliminate it first. Now your odds are closer to 67%. And since this part of the TOGAF Certification exam tests your ability to reason through a TOGAF scenario, it is important you understand how to apply TOGAF. If you follow Tip #1 above you should have no problem acing this part!

Watch our TOGAF Certification training video on some strategies you can use to tackle the TOGAF® 9 Level 2 Exam Questions effectively.

Tackling Those Effectively!
</h2>

<h3>3. Learn about Agile Development.</h3>
TOGAF relies heavily on the agile principles of iterative and incremental development. Gaining a solid grounding in agile thinking will help you understand how to apply TOGAF and specifically the ADM.
<h3>4. Read the TOGAF Certification Exam Study Guides.</h3>
The Open Group have provided two study guides one for each part of the exam. I strongly recommend reading at least the Part 1 study guide. It covers all possible content that could appear in the Part 1 exam. And at under 200 pages it is a far briefer read! If you have time, the Part 2 Study Guide is also a good read.
<h3>5. Understand how Part 2 of the TOGAF Certification Exam Questions are designed.</h3>
In Part 2 of the TOGAF Certification exam, you are given a scenario which gives context to the possible responses. It is important to determine the central focus of the scenario – typically a Phase of the ADM. But sometimes it is another aspect such as security or interoperability. Figuring out this central focal point for each question is critical to understanding which of the four responses is the best one. Take your time with this; you have roughly 12 minutes per question in Part 2. Spend at least half of this time reading the scenario carefully, the rest reading every response and finding the best answer as described in Tip #2.
<h3>6. Practice, Practice, Practice!</h3>
Study with our Free TOGAF Certification Exam practice test and test your skills to pass the exam!

Do as many sample exam questions as you can find! The more questions you are exposed to the more you will understand TOGAF and the less likely you will be to be surprised by whatever questions appear in the TOGAF certification exam.

<h3>7. It’s not just about ICT.</h3>
Although the origins of TOGAF lie in the ICT realm, this is a heritage that the TOGAF creators want you to forget…TOGAF is about the enterprise and not just about ICT and questions that focus only on ICT should be considered suspicious and probably wrong!
<h3>8. Good Exam Technique.</h3>
When you take the TOGAF Certification exam,  Part 2 will be open book – the TOGAF specification in all its glory will be available to you in PDF form for use during the whole 90 minutes. Use it! Don’t be afraid to search the specification for things like definitions which may not be clear, or any aspects of the ADM that you are not sure about. And keep Section 31 in mind! This is where all the artifacts for TOGAF are defined – they are guaranteed to make an appearance at some point so understanding exactly what they are used for will be critical to getting the right answer.
<h3>9. Pace Yourself:</h3>
For Part 1 of the TOGAF Certification exam you will have on average around 2 minutes to spend on each question. And you are able to move backwards and forwards through all the questions in Part 1 and answer them in any order. Take advantage of this! Answer all the questions that you absolutely know the answers to without hesitation first – this will buy you time for those questions you are not so sure about.

In Part 2 of the TOGAF Certification exam, you have 12 minutes per question, use all of this time, especially to read every one of the four possible answers. Comparing answers will help you sort them into a continuum from “most TOGAF-centric” to “least TOGAF-centric”. After all you are looking for the BEST response – there may be several correct answers but you only want the best one, from a TOGAF perspective.
<h3>10. Finally, Don’t Panic.</h3>
You got this! I recommend putting most of your preparation efforts into Part 1 of the exam (60 to 70%) and the rest into Part 2.

You must pass Part 1 of the TOGAF Certification exam in order to proceed to Part 2 and your odds of passing Part 2 are quite good…you can reason through Part 2 and you have access to the specification after all.
